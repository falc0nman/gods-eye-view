// src/scenes/scenePolicy.js — pure decisions for cinematic scene playback.
//
// The scene director was written when the app shipped four data layers, and its
// shot recipes (src/scenes/recipes.js) still declare exactly those four:
// flights, satellites, earthquakes, traffic. The registry has since grown to
// sixteen. The original reconcile walked the LIVE registry and forced every
// layer absent from the shot to off, so a recipe that never had an opinion
// about CCTV, vessels, fires, radio, cables, dams or datacenters silently tore
// them down — and nothing puts them back, because playback has no restore pass.
//
// A shot's layer map is an assertion about the layers it NAMES, not a claim of
// authority over every layer that will ever exist. Recipes already spell out
// the layers they want OFF (see 'thermal-threats', which declares
// flights/satellites/traffic false), so honouring only the declared keys keeps
// every authored intent intact while leaving undeclared layers alone.
//
// Operator-captured shots are unaffected: captureShot() snapshots the whole
// registry (director._captureLayerStates), so those shots declare all sixteen
// keys and still reconcile in full.

/**
 * Layer params that re-establish a tracked contact — and with it a SECOND
 * writer on the camera.
 *
 * A capture taken while following a plane snapshots that layer's whole param
 * set, tracking id included. Replaying it would hand the camera back to the
 * follow loop the scene just took it from (see director._claimCameraOwnership
 * and src/data/trackedCamera.js): the shot flight and the follow camera then
 * both write the frame, which is the documented jitter failure mode.
 *
 * So playback NEVER re-establishes tracking. The keys stay in the stored
 * capture — a project file is a record of what the operator saw, and a future
 * reader may want it — they are simply dropped on the way to the layer.
